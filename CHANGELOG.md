## [Unreleased]

### Added

#### Terminal protocol
- **Kitty keyboard protocol** levels 2–5: REPORT_EVENT_TYPES (release/repeat), REPORT_ALTERNATE_KEYS, REPORT_ALL_KEYS_AS_ESC (required by Helix/Neovim), REPORT_ASSOCIATED_TEXT. (Level 1 / DISAMBIGUATE_ESC_CODES was already present.)
- **modifyOtherKeys** (XTMODKEYS, `CSI > 4 ; N m`) levels 0–2: modified printable keys emit `CSI 27 ; mods ; code ~` as legacy TUIs expect.
- **Synchronized output** (DECSET/DECRST 2026): terminal output is buffered during `?2026h…?2026l` brackets and the UI wakes only once per completed frame, preventing mid-render paints.
- **OSC 7** shell CWD tracking: new tabs and pane splits inherit the shell's reported working directory.
- **OSC 9 / OSC 777** desktop notifications forwarded to the OS via `notify-rust`.
- **OSC 9;4** progress state: a subtle progress indicator rendered in the status bar when a running application reports progress.
- **OSC 52** clipboard read/write: applications can read and write the system clipboard via escape sequences.
- **OSC 133** shell-integration semantic marks (A/B/C/D prompt and command boundaries), enabling jump-to-prompt navigation.
- **Plain-text URL detection**: plain URLs in the grid are hoverable and `Ctrl+Click`-able, not just OSC 8 hyperlinks.

#### Split panes
- **Split panes**: `Ctrl+Shift+E` splits vertically (left | right), `Ctrl+Shift+O` splits horizontally (top / bottom); arbitrary recursive tiling.
- **Pane resize**: drag the divider gutter to resize; gutter shows hover feedback.
- **Pane focus**: `Alt+Arrow` moves focus between adjacent panes.
- **Pane headers**: per-pane title bar showing the shell's foreground process and working directory (sourced from `/proc` + OSC 7); includes a close box and a `⋮` split menu. Toggleable via `pane_headers` config key or `Ctrl+Shift+B` via the palette.
- **Close pane**: `Ctrl+Shift+W` closes the focused pane; falls back to closing the whole tab when only one pane remains.
- **Incremental split render**: each pane redraws only its own damage, not the whole surface.

#### Overlays and chrome
- **Command palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P`): fuzzy-searchable list of every action and setting; type to filter, arrow/Enter to invoke. Covers tabs, panes, font, themes, scrollback, toggles.
- **In-terminal search** (`Ctrl+Shift+F`): regex find bar at the bottom, all-match highlighting in the viewport, `Enter`/`Shift+Enter` for next/prev, pre-fills from an active selection.
- **Real-GUI settings form** (`Ctrl+,`): extended with font family dropdown, scrollback stepper, status bar toggle, pane headers toggle; Tab/arrow navigation; saves to config file.
- **Help overlay** (`F1`): now scrollable; includes split-pane bindings, palette and search, window shortcuts.
- **Status bar** (`Ctrl+Shift+B`): optional bottom bar with OSC 9;4 progress indicator; off by default; toggled via config, CLI, or the command palette.

#### Tabs
- **Tab drag-reorder**: drag a tab chip to reorder tabs.
- **Tab rename**: double-click a tab chip to open an inline rename editor; Enter commits, Esc cancels; custom title overrides the OSC title.
- **Touchpad swipe**: a horizontal touchpad swipe over the tab bar cycles one tab per gesture.

#### Configuration and profiles
- **Config hot-reload**: glassy watches the config file with `notify` and applies changes without a restart.
- **Named profiles** (`[profile.NAME]` sections): activated at launch with `--profile NAME`; CLI flags still override the profile.
- **Per-side padding**: `padding_top`, `padding_bottom`, `padding_left`, `padding_right` override the uniform `padding`.
- **`follow_system`**: tracks the OS light/dark color scheme; `theme_light` / `theme_dark` pick the theme per mode.
- **`restore_session`**: persists tabs, pane layouts, and per-pane cwds to `$XDG_STATE_HOME/glassy/session.json`; restored on next launch when the key is set.
- **`word_separator`**: additional characters treated as word boundaries during double-click selection.
- **`cwd`**: initial working directory for the first tab's shell.
- **`status_bar`** and **`pane_headers`** config keys.
- **`--import-theme <path>`**: load an Alacritty TOML or base16 YAML color theme at startup.
- **Custom color overrides**: `color.fg`, `color.bg`, `color.cursor`, `color.selection_bg`, `color.ansi0`–`color.ansi15` override any named theme's colors in-place.

#### Text and font
- **Ligature shaping**: opt-in (`ligatures = true`) OpenType GSUB `liga` shaping across full cell runs.
- **`font_features`**: force-enable or disable individual OpenType feature tags (e.g. `ss01, calt=0`).
- **Procedural Powerline glyphs** (`E0B0`–`E0B3`): rendered as pixel-perfect filled polygons via the Nerd Font default font, gap-free at all sizes.
- **Nerd Font wide-icon promotion**: single-codepoint Nerd Font icons that are logically wide are promoted to two-cell width.

#### Images
- **Inline images** — kitty graphics protocol (PNG incl. 8/16-bit and palette, raw RGBA, chunked `f=` transfers, `c=`/`r=` cell sizing, aspect-aware, `a=d` delete) and **sixel**, drawn on a dedicated GPU atlas; images clear on screen-clear / reset.

#### Themes
- Added **Rosé Pine Dawn** (light) and **Catppuccin Latte** (light): 10 built-in themes total, including two light themes.

#### Packaging and distribution
- **Debian / Ubuntu `.deb`**, **Fedora / RHEL / openSUSE `.rpm`**, **Arch AUR** (`glassy` and `glassy-bin`), **macOS `.dmg`** (universal binary), **Flatpak** manifest, **Homebrew tap** skeleton.
- **`curl | bash` installer** (`scripts/install.sh`): downloads the latest binary, verifies SHA-256, installs to `~/.local/bin`.
- **Release CI**: GitHub Actions publishes all package artifacts on tag.

#### Performance
- Allocation-free redraw path: direct glyph-instance push, persistent flush-pass scratch, removed a redundant glyph-cache layer.
- Skip default-background cell quads; fewer GPU state rebinds for the image pass.
- Dropped the `image` and `regex` crate stacks (smaller binary).
- **iGPU by default**: renderer selects the low-power (integrated) GPU adapter; override with `GLASSY_GPU=high`.

### Changed

- glassy now owns its PTY read loop (taps image/OSC/protocol sequences before alacritty_terminal sees them).
- Softer, accent-tinted visual bell (was a stark white full-screen flash).
- Narrow-base emoji (e.g. the trans flag) render at full size.
- The settings overlay uses an immediate-mode GUI layer (`src/gui/`) with animated hover/toggle feedback and real keyboard navigation.
- Tab bar activity dots and busy spinner animate only while a background tab is producing output; the event loop parks at `ControlFlow::Wait` (0% idle) otherwise.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-19

Initial release.

### Added

- GPU-accelerated rendering: an instanced `wgpu` renderer fed by a dynamic
  glyph atlas, with on-demand, damage-based redraw to stay idle when nothing
  changes.

- Color emoji rendering with CJK font fallback.
- Procedural box-drawing characters for crisp, gap-free lines.
- Text decorations: underline, double, curly, dotted, dashed, strikethrough,

- Mouse support: SGR reporting, text selection, and clipboard copy/paste.
  Scrollback buffer.
- Tabs with a slim title bar and scrollback indicator.
